    "In this 10-day introductory workshop, the first week will cover the basics of Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the second week, we will highlight some of the Python tools that are particularly useful to social scientists. This will include topics like loading data from files, manipulating the data, and creating visualizations. We will not really cover the standard list of libraries that one would learn in an introductory workshop on Python. Instead, the course will place more emphasis on libraries that can be of interest to the typical ICPSR audience."

    "### Office Hours Poll\n",
    "Currently, I have OH setup right after every class for 1hr. Please fill out this [poll](https://forms.gle/dwUSeBmzpwY67eqt7) so I can decide whether I need to shuffle them around. \n",
